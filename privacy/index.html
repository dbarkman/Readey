        <h4>Readey, the iOS App, and speedReadey.com, the website, both adhere to this very simple and straightforward Privacy Policy</h4>

    <div>
        We will not, under any circumstances whatsoever, give out or sell your information (including your name and email address) to anyone. Period.
        <br /><br />
        We will also never send you an email unless you email us first or provide your email in a feedback or support form.
        <br /><br />
        Also, no one will ever have access to your saved articles, or any other data. The only exceptions to this rule:
        <br /><br />
        <li>From time to time, a developer will have to access source code in order to update the app or website, perform routine maintenance, and possibly fix bugs. However, all your data will still remain 100% confidential.</li>
        <li>It's possible that we will be required by subpoena or other legal action to grant access to an individual in the process of an investigation.</li>
